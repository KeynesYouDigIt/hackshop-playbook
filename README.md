### About this repo

This is a playbook for running a hackshop -- part hackathon, part lean workshop. We're developing this as part of our partnership with Code For America, for Code for America brigades who want to run 1-2 day events for the purpose of recruiting new brigade members, for hackathons, or for kickstarting new projects within their brigades. 

As a first step to running a Hackshop event, we recommend forking this repository, editing the README to be specific to your event, and going to Settings-> GitHub Automatic Page Generator and loading your repository's README.md to stand up a quick website for your event. 

See [HackshopNC](http://waffleio.github.io/hackshopNC/) for an example from our pilot event. 

*Note that this playbook is in beta, and is a work in progress. As we continue to run hackshops and spread the word to Code for America brigades, we'll be iterating and expanding on the content.*
