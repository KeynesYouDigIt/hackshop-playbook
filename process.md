## Use [Hackshop.waffle.io](http://hackshop.waffle.io) 
The Hackshop App guides teams through the process of a Hackshop by generating cards/GitHub Issues for their Waffle boards.

## Use the Hackshop Template Slides (on Google Slides)
Located [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DOZ4FcHaX3QUClh_bzQ6pIu_yXm_6UpeurA8c6lqZUY/edit?usp=sharing), or cereate slides of your own. The purpose of slides is to keep everyone focused, prominently display timeboxes while keeping time, and to assist with guiding attendees through sections of the Hackshop when appropriate.

## Use a timer to timebox all sections to be the most efficient. Have the timer displayed prominently throughout the entire event. (One person should take ownership over time keeping.)
