# Transparent, Simple Tooling
We’ve put together the right set of tools to help teams be productive in the shortest period of time. In addition to helping teams move fast, this tool set will allow transparency for optimized community engagement and easy continuation of the project following the event. 

## Use GitHub 
GitHub has paved the way for [open collaboration](http://ben.balter.com/2014/01/27/open-collaboration/), making it the perfect place to start

## Use [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io) for Issue Management 
Before you have any code in need of a repository, you’re going to have to-do’s. GitHub’s native issue tracker is a great place to start. Waffle lives on top of GitHub and utilizes the same source of record, while also providing a free lightweight project management layer for easier organization and visualization of GitHub Issues at the team level. 

## Use Hackshop.waffle.io 
The easiest way to get teams set up with the work they need to do for each sprint is by using hackshop.waffle.io. THe Waffle Hackshop app will provide teams with a prepopulated set of Issues that can be moved from Ready to In Progress to Done on their Waffle boards as they work through each sprint.

## Use a Chat Tool, ([Gitter.im](http://gitter.im)) for Remote Support
Depending on your event, you may or may not be able to get experts from the field on site to help your participants. A simple way to engage specialists in the field with your event attendees is to provide support from remote specialists during specific time intervals using a chat tool like Gitter or Slack. 

Gitter is a free tool that adds a badge to your repository for easy accessibility. All you need is a GitHub account to access a Gitter chat room, and you can choose to set up a chat room for your event or by repository.

Slack is also free, but requires that you invite attendees individually by email for free accounts. Logistically, Gitter is the simplest option. Slack is widely used and should be considered when your event is less than 20 attendees or if your community or remote specialists already have an established Slack presence. 

## Use a [Lean Canvas](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/100216/9820403/c53c9b24-5881-11e5-8c05-4d6549b82b81.jpg)
Teams should be focused on rapid experimentation and prototypign throughout the event, and the lean canvas is a great way to focus on the right things at the right time. 

[This is a great tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o8uYdUaFR4) from Ash Maurya on how to document a business model using a lean canvas. [The Hackshop App](http://hackshop.waffle.io) will also generate cards on teams' Waffle boards to guide teams through what they need to do for each section used during the Hackshop.
